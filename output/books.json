    "Review": "<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" is a timeless classic that captures the essence of the Roaring Twenties in America. The novel follows the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan.</p>\n\n<p>Fitzgerald's prose is elegant and poetic, painting a vivid picture of the lavish parties and the underlying emptiness of the era. The characters are complex and flawed, making them feel incredibly real and relatable despite the glamorous setting.</p>\n\n<p>The themes of the American Dream, wealth, and the corruption that often accompanies it are masterfully explored throughout the narrative. Fitzgerald's critique of the excessive materialism and moral decay of the time remains relevant even today.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most striking aspects of the novel is its narrator, Nick Carraway. His outsider perspective provides a unique lens through which we view the events and characters, adding depth and complexity to the story.</p>\n\n<p>While the pacing can be slow at times, the build-up to the dramatic conclusion is worth the wait. The ending leaves a lasting impact, prompting reflection on the nature of ambition, love, and the past.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, \"The Great Gatsby\" is a must-read for anyone interested in American literature. Its beautiful prose, complex characters, and timeless themes make it a book that can be revisited multiple times, each reading revealing new layers of meaning.</p>\n"
